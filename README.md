# FYP-management-system


This FYP Management System is built using MySQL and PHP, designed to streamline the process of managing final year projects. It consists of four panels:

1. Student Panel: Students can use this panel to submit their project proposals, view assigned supervisors, and track the progress of their projects. They can also upload project reports and check deadlines.

2. Teacher Panel: Supervisors (teachers) can review and approve student project proposals, give feedback, assign grades, and monitor the overall progress of the students they are supervising.

3. Program Manager Panel: The program manager oversees the entire FYP process, managing project assignments, approving teacher-student pairings, and setting important deadlines. They can also view progress reports and ensure that projects are on track.

4. Admin Panel: The admin has full control over the system, including managing user accounts (students, teachers, program managers), viewing project reports, and handling any system-wide issues or updates.

This system efficiently automates the project submission and tracking process, ensuring smooth communication between students, teachers, and program managers.
